This program has been created to be a solid sphere with a resize animation and a diffuse color control.

- **R key:** Decrease the Red color spectrum in the diffuse value.
- **Shift + R key:** Increase the Red color spectrum in the diffuse value.
- **G key:** Decrease the Green color spectrum in the diffuse value.
- **Shift + G key:** Increase the Green color spectrum in the diffuse value.
- **B key:** Decrease the Blue color spectrum in the diffuse value.
- **Shift + B key:** Increase the Blue color spectrum in the diffuse value.

### The colors
The only colors available for the diffuse control is Red, Green and Blue. But you can mix the three colors to get new ones.
